# üîß Industrial Copper Modeling

A machine learning project focused on predictive modeling in the manufacturing domain using real-world copper sales data. This project covers both **regression** (predicting `Selling_Price`) and **classification** (predicting `Status` as WON or LOST), along with an interactive **Streamlit** web application for real-time predictions.

## üß© Problem Statement

The copper manufacturing industry often deals with skewed and noisy sales and pricing data. This can lead to inaccurate manual forecasting. To overcome this:

1. Implement **regression modeling** to predict the `Selling_Price`.
2. Build a **classification model** to predict lead `Status` (WON or LOST).
3. Develop a **Streamlit-based UI** for live predictions based on user inputs.

## üìä Approach

### 1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
- Drop non-informative columns.
- Remove garbage values.
- Convert columns into proper format.
- Treat categorical variables as category types.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing values using mean/median/mode.
- Detect and treat outliers using IQR.
- Apply transformations to reduce skewness.
- Encode categorical variables (Label or One-Hot Encoding).
- Standardize/normalize features.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize skewness and outliers using:
  - Boxplots
  - Histograms
- Identify highly correlated features using heatmaps.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
- Create new variables if applicable.
- Drop redundant or highly correlated features.

### 5. **Model Building**
#### üîµ Regression Model
- Target: `Selling_Price`
- Models used: DecisionTreesRegressor
- Metrics: RMSE, R¬≤, MAE

#### üî¥ Classification Model
- Target: `Status` (WON/LOST)
- Models used: DecisionTreesClassifier
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

- Use cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

The app consists of:

- A toggle to choose between **Regression** or **Classification**.
- Interactive form to input feature values.
- Model predictions displayed in real-time.
- Backend uses pre-fitted **pickle** models for:
  - Scalers
  - Encoders
  - ML Models
